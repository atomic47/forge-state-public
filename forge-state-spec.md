# forge-state — Specification

**Version:** 0.1 (draft for lock)
**Status:** Architecture converged; five open decisions flagged in §18.
**Pattern family:** local-first state facility (sibling to desk-state, work-state, notella).

---

## 1. Purpose

forge-state is a lab bench for open-source projects. You mark a project announcement in Slack; nightly, the facility researches it, clones it, builds it inside a sealed box, runs a real experiment against it, packages it into something runnable, and ships two artifacts — a writeup and deployable code. Build failures are kept, not discarded; "this does not build on a clean machine" is a finding worth publishing.

The unit of work is an **experiment**: one marked repo carried through a fixed lifecycle. Each experiment is independent and idempotent.

---

## 2. Invariants

These hold across every skill and every run. Violating one is a defect.

1. **Local-first.** The facility lives on your machine. Nothing requires a server. "Deploy" means outputs leave the host for surfaces (gist, blog, registry) — the facility itself never moves.
2. **File-per-entity YAML, append-only NDJSON.** One record per file. Logs only append. YAML on disk is canonical; any index is derived and disposable.
3. **Single-writer.** The nightly run is the only writer. A lockfile prevents an overrunning night from colliding with the next trigger.
4. **Two-plane isolation.** The host is the control plane (holds secrets, runs reasoning and publishing). The Docker container is the data plane (untrusted, no secrets, builds and runs the repo). The build never executes in the host shell.
5. **Build-failed is terminal-with-findings.** A failed build advances to a report, not a halt.
6. **Deterministic gist.** Every published build record carries the exact environment and commands that produced it — reproducible, not anecdotal.
7. **Secrets never reach the data plane or the outputs.** No token enters the container; outputs are scrubbed before they ship.

## 3. Topology

```
┌─────────────────────────── HOST (control plane) ───────────────────────────┐

│                                       │  forge-packager (package)   │       │
│                                       └── disposable, per-repo ─────┘       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The boundary is crossed one way: repo and commands in, results out. Nothing trusted enters the container; nothing untrusted runs on the host.

## 4. Facility layout

```
~/forge/                          # visible — "your stuff" is browsable
  manifest.yaml                   # facility config (channels, images, surfaces, caps)
  experiments/
    EXP-0007-ripgrep-turbo/
      experiment.yaml             # the record — file-per-entity, canonical
      research.md
      build/
        log.txt
        env.json                  # reproducible environment manifest
      deploy/                     # the deployable artifact
        Dockerfile
        compose.yaml
        RUN.md
      artifacts/                  # screenshots, sample outputs
      report.md
  .state/                         # machinery
    state.json                    # derived snapshot — counts, cursor, last run
    activity.ndjson               # append-only log
    cursor.yaml                   # per-channel last-processed reaction
    forge.lock                    # single-writer guard
    logs/
      run-2026-06-21.txt
```

`experiments/` is the durable record. `.state/` is rebuildable from it.

                                                         reported ◄┘
                                                            │

```

- **candidate** — harvested from a marked Slack post; not yet touched.
- **researched** — what/who/why/comparables/license captured.
- **cloned** — repo on disk, commit pinned.
- **built** | **build-failed** — sandboxed build attempted; either outcome continues.
- **experimented** — bounded experiment run (skipped on build-failed).
- **packaged** — deployable artifact emitted (skipped on build-failed).
- **reported** — report composed (both senses; build-failed reports the failure).
- **published** — outputs shipped to surfaces.

A build-failed experiment routes `build-failed → reported → published` directly.

---

## 7. Skill suite

Nine skills. Eight are pure single-purpose workers; the orchestrator routes and holds no state.

| Skill | Plane | Reads | Writes / does |
|---|---|---|---|
| **forge-state** | host | facility | read/write/validate substrate; the only writer to disk |
| **forge-harvester-slack** | host | Slack | marked posts → candidate records; advances cursor |
| **forge-researcher** | host | web | research block + license; `research.md` |
| **forge-builder** | data | repo | clone, pin commit, classify, build in sandbox; `build/env.json`, exit, logs |
| **forge-experimenter** | host+data | repo | classify type → template → run in sandbox; experiment block, artifacts |
| **forge-packager** | data | built repo | Dockerfile + compose + RUN.md; optional image push |
| **forge-reporter** | host | record | `report.md` (handles success and failure) |
| **forge-publisher** | host | record | gist + blog draft + work-state events; scrub secrets |
| **forge-orchestrator** | host | state | nightly queue walk; thin router; `--once` |

Every skill routes its reads and writes through **forge-state**. No skill writes the substrate directly.

---

## 8. Intake contract

- You react with the marker (`🧪`) on a project post in a designated channel.
- The reaction — not the post — is the trigger. This decouples "I shared a link" from "I want this built," and lets you curate after posting.
- Idempotency key is `(channel, message_ts)`. The cursor records the last-processed reaction per channel; re-runs skip already-harvested posts.
- Only your own reactions count (`markers_self_only`), so a colleague's emoji doesn't enqueue a build.

---

## 9. Sandbox

- **Runtime:** Docker Desktop (mac and Windows — the cross-platform common denominator).
- **Image:** per-language base selected by the builder's classifier (§10), generic fallback.
- **Egress:** deny-by-default; package registries allowed. No path to host secrets or the open internet beyond fetching dependencies.
- **Resources:** CPU and memory capped (manifest); per-repo wall-clock timeout.
- **Lifecycle:** fresh container per repo, torn down after results are read. No reuse, no persistence.
- **Env manifest (`build/env.json`):** OS, base image digest, runtime versions, exact commands, exit codes, timings. This is the reproducibility anchor the gist depends on.

---

## 10. Experiment taxonomy

Mode is hybrid: classify the repo, pick a template, improvise within the template's bounds. Templates keep the experimenter from flailing; improvisation keeps it useful.

| Type | Detection signal | Experiment template |
|---|---|---|
| **cli** | binary entrypoint, `bin/`, argparse/clap | run against sample input; compare to a named comparable |
| **library** | package manifest, no entrypoint | 20-line harness exercising the headline API |
| **webapp** | dev server, framework manifest | boot, hit health/route, screenshot |
| **mcp** | MCP server manifest / SDK dep | connect, list tools, call one |
| **service** | Dockerfile, daemon, port bind | compose up, probe the port |
| **model** | notebook, weights, ML deps | load, run one inference on a fixture |

Classification is the builder's job (it already inspects the tree to choose a base image); the experimenter consumes the type.

---

## 11. Packaging — the deployable artifact

forge-packager turns a built repo into something runnable and shareable.

- **Always:** emit a `deploy/` bundle — `Dockerfile`, `compose.yaml`, `RUN.md` (the exact `docker run` / `compose up` invocation, plus what it does). Self-contained; shareable without any registry.
- **Optional (open §18.1):** push the image to GHCR so it is `docker pull`-able. Gated behind a configured registry + token.
- The bundle reuses the build's env manifest, so the packaged artifact and the gist agree on environment.
- On build-failed: no package; the report explains why it could not be produced.

---

## 12. Publishing — outputs

forge-publisher fans out. Two senses of deploy, both covered.

1. **Writeup:**
   - **Gist** — the reproducible build record: env manifest, commands, results, and the deploy bundle. Auto.
   - **Blog draft** — scsiwyg, your publishing voice, held for review by default (open §18.2).
   - **Report** — `report.md` filed in the experiment folder.
2. **Code:**
   - The `deploy/` bundle, linked from the gist and the report; image pushed if §18.1 is on.
3. **Signal:**
   - `build` and `publish` events emitted to work-state — this activity is itself harvestable.

All outputs pass a secret scrub before they leave the host.

---

## 13. Orchestration

- **Nightly walk:** harvest new marked posts since cursor → for each candidate, advance through the lifecycle → emit a run summary.
- **Queue:** any non-terminal experiment is in the queue. No separate queue file; phase is the queue.
- **Overlap guard:** `forge.lock` (flock). A run refuses to start if one is active.
- **Budget:** per-repo timeout and a nightly wall-clock budget. Experiments not reached carry forward to the next night.
- **On-demand:** `forge-orchestrator --once` runs the same walk immediately, ignoring the schedule.

---

## 14. Deployment & runtime

- **Trigger:** launchd (mac) / Task Scheduler (Windows), nightly.
- **Vehicle:** headless Claude Code invocation that runs the orchestrator. The schedule is dumb; the orchestrator is the brain.
- **Host requirements:** Docker Desktop running; the secret store unlocked; egress to the surfaces.
- **No server.** Runs entirely on your workstation.

---

## 15. Secrets

- Host-only, in the configured store (sops/age or equivalent). Loaded into the control-plane environment at run start.
- Never written to the facility, the container, the gist, or the report.
- The publisher scrubs outputs against the known secret set before shipping.

---

## 16. Durability

- Local disk is the system of record; NDJSON is canonical history.
- Optional git mirror to a configured remote (open §18.4). A lost gist regenerates from the report record; a lost facility does not — the mirror is the backstop.

---

## 17. Observability

- **Run summary** posted to the intake channel: "tonight: N built, M build-failed, K carried."
- **Dead-man alert** if no run completes in 25h.
- **work-state events** give the longitudinal view for free.

---

## 18. Open decisions (lock before build)

1. **Packaged-artifact reach** — `deploy/` bundle only (no registry), or also push to GHCR (`docker pull`-able). Default: bundle only.
2. **Blog auto-publish** — hold as draft (default), or auto-publish like desk.
3. **Intake channel + marker** — the channel name and the reaction emoji.
4. **Durability mirror** — git remote (GitHub private / a Gitea / other) or local-only.
5. **Facility location** — `~/forge/` visible + `.state/` machinery (default), or fully dotted.

---

## 19. Build sequence

1. **forge-state + scaffolder** — substrate, schema, manifest, validate.
2. **forge-harvester-slack** — emoji gate → candidates, cursor.
3. **forge-builder + sandbox** — Docker, classify, build, env manifest. Riskiest; prove first.
4. **forge-experimenter** — taxonomy templates.
5. **forge-packager** — deploy bundle, optional push.
6. **forge-reporter + forge-publisher** — outputs, scrub, fan-out.
7. **forge-orchestrator + trigger** — nightly walk, lockfile, budget, `--once`.

Prove the path with `--once` on three to five repos before enabling the timer. Do not automate an unproven build path.
